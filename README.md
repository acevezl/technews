### Viewing posts
By default, the app will list all posts available. General public can interact with the home page to scroll through the posts and see them in a one-by-one setting. However, in order to comment and like posts, users must register.

### Register
The app has a signup functionality to register users. Once you've registerd, it will return you back to the login page. At that point you may use your newly created credentials.

### Login
Login in is pretty stadard - enter credentials, log in. Enter wrong credentials, stay where you are. Yes, future state I'll add a user message, for now, the focus is on MVC, not front end.

After logging in, users land on the dashboard.

### Le C.R.U.D. it√©
Once logged in, users may Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete posts from their dashboard.

### Liking and commenting
I've implemented a somewhat Facebook-ish Like feature. Registered users can click on the thumbs up on any post. Whether it is on their dashboard, or on the homepage. 

It works as a toggle: click it once, you liked the post, clicked it again, and your like is gone.

Ah yes, and you can comment too...

### Session
The app has a handler for session inactivity. If any logged user spends more than 3 minutes idle (that is: no mouse move, no key press), a message will be displayed to alert user of imminent logout.

If no action is taken after the message, the app will logout in 60 seconds.

### View
All views are manged via handlebars. For that reason, the following code is needed:

```
const exphbs = require('express-handlebars');
...
const helpers = require('./utils/helpers');

const hbs = exphbs.create({ helpers });

app.engine('handlebars', hbs.engine);
app.set('view engine', 'handlebars');
```
Specific hdb files exist for each functionality, and code is modularized to utilize partials. For example, these two are somewhat similar:
```
dashboard.handlebars
homepage.handlebars
```
Therefore they both use:
```
partials/post-info
```

Example using homepage:

```
<h5>Tech Blog Home</h5>
{{#each posts as |post|}}
<!-- Post -->
<div class="post">
    {{> post-info post}}
    <a class="button" href="/post/{{id}}" id="view-{{id}}">view</a>
</div>
{{/each}}

{{#if loggedIn}}
<script src="/assets/js/upvote.js"></script>
{{/if}}
```

The following line paints each post:
```
{{> post-info post}}
```

Here's what post-info.handlebars look like:
```
{{!-- Post body --}}

    <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns post-body">
            <div class="post-title row">
                <h5 class="ten columns">{{title}}</h5>
                <h5 class="two columns post-likes upvote-btn"><span class="oi oi-thumb-up {{#if liked}}active{{/if}}" post-id="{{id}}"> </span>  {{vote_count}}</h5>
            </div>
            <h6>By <strong class="pointer">{{user.username}}</strong> on {{format_date createdAt}}, read full article here: <span class="post-url"><a href="{{post_url}}">{{format_url post_url}}</a></span></h6>
            <p class="post-text">
                {{post_text}}
            </p>
            <div class="row">
                <h5 class="one column post-comments"><span class="oi oi-comment-square"> </span>  {{comment_count}} </h5>
                <ul class="eleven columns">
                {{#each comments as |comment|}}
                    {{> comment-info comment}}
                {{/each}}
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
```
### Controller
The glue between the model and view is the controller. I've separated the controller routes based on functionality: API vs HTML.

API routes are used to create, retrieve, update, and delete. While HTML routes are used to stitch the workflow of the front-end to back-end.
